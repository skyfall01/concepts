### Network Devices
**Hubs**:
- Layer 1 device. Antiquated
- Dumb (Multiport repeater). Basically sent PDU to all ports(broadcast)
- Collisions occur mostly affecting network performance 

**Switches**:
- Layer 2 device
- Smart (Basically frames are sent from one device to another device by inspecting source & destination MAC adddress)
- Since no broadcast, network performance is much better
- Builds up MAC/CAM(Content addressable memory) table to remmeber MAC address of device connected to ports
- Break up collision domains. However collisions can still occur. Use CSMA/CD to mitigate this issue

**Wireless Access Point(WAP)**:
- Layer 2 device
- Just provide wireless access for a wired network
- Note: Router is not WAP. WAP just provides wireless access & nothing else

**Routers**:
- Layer 3 device
- Routes traffic for devices in same or different networks
- Uses routing protocols to determine path of packets

**Modem**:
- Modulate/Demodulate analog to digital signals
- Layer 1 device

## Ethernet
Set of standards enabling LAN 

### Cabling
Primarily 3 types
**Co-axial**:

**Twisted-Pair**

**Fiber**:
